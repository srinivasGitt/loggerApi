how do i resolve a merge conflict
1. i would try to pull the branch which is having conflicts to my local machine
2. once it is pulled i would check for conflicts manually in every file and resolve them one by one
3. I would collaborate with the concerned person and discuss where and how the colflicts happeded that would help to reolve the conflits faster

not recommended ways 
it's not a good idea to resolve the colflicts in the github editor

how to avoid conflits is to always maintain a proper communitation with 
the team and know who's working along with me on same brach 
always create a new branch while working on new tasks
